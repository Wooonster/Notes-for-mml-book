This repository is owned by Wonster.

The repository collects the note I wrote for the book *MATHEMATICS FOR MACHINE LEARNING* when learning course COMP6670 Intro to Machine Learning in ANU.

The content is mostly directly from the book. There could be some mistakes because of not full concentration though. Also, some may be missing because of laziness.
